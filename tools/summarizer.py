    """
    Orchestrates an exhaustive technical synthesis of raw research data into a high-density brief.

    WHEN TO USE:
    - Use during the 'Synthesis Phase' after retrieving raw text via fetch_page_tool.
    - Use when the source material is fragmented, 'noisy' (ads/menus), or exceeds 2,000 characters.
    - Use to isolate critical technical evidence like version numbers (e.g., Python 3.13), performance metrics, and architectural changes.
    WHEN NOT TO USE:
    - Do not use if the content is already a concise summary or under 500 characters.
    - Do not use for initial web discovery (use web_search_tool instead).

    INPUTS:
    - content (str): The raw, unprocessed text string scraped from the web.
    - topic (str): The specific technical subject to isolate from the surrounding noise (e.g., 'Python 3.13 JIT Compiler').
    - max_words (int): Target word count for the detailed brief. Range: 100 to 1500. Default: 1000.

    OUTPUT:
    - Returns a structured 'Summarization Directive'.
    - IMPORTANT: Upon receiving this output, you MUST act as a Technical Editor and generate the 1000-word summary immediately before proceeding to planning.
    - Your internal analysis must prioritize: Hard Data, Core Arguments, and Developer Impact.
