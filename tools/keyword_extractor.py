    Expert SEO Keyword Extractor for the 'Optimization Phase' of blog planning.

    WHEN TO USE:
    - Use when you have completed raw research and summarization and need to identify impactful SEO terms.
    - Use as the final bridge when moving from the 'Research Phase' to the 'Planning Phase'.
    - Use to ensure the post targets a specific technical audience (e.g., Data Scientists using WSL2).
    WHEN NOT TO USE:
    - Do not use before you have a technical summary or raw research text.
    - Do not use for general brainstorming without source material.

    INPUTS:
    - text (str): The research summary or technical brief to be analyzed.
    - topic (str): The primary subject (e.g., 'Python 3.13 Internals') to ensure relevance.
    - max_keywords (int): Number of keywords to identify. Range: 5 to 15. Default: 10.

    OUTPUT & AGENT RESPONSIBILITY:
    - This tool returns a 'Structured Extraction Directive' containing a high-confidence baseline of terms.
    - IMPORTANT: This tool DOES NOT return the final keywords. It returns an instruction set.
    - You MUST perform an internal analysis of the research text based on this directive.
    - Your final response MUST be ONLY a clean JSON array of strings (e.g., ["keyword1", "keyword2"]).
